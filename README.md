# Wish.com-Product-Rating-Prediction

The goal is to predict the product ratings given the other features known for a product on Wish.com. Ratings are in categories from 1 to 5. For one product, the higher the rating is, the more the customers like the product. In this way, when you have a new product to be put on wish.com, you can estimate how likely people will like your product, without actually listing out there. Also, by doing this, it helps us to understand under what certain conditions that a product will be highly rated, as a way to understand the customer base of wish.com. The dataset is not clean and I applied data preprocessing and removed noises. We'll use LabelEncoding, drop duplicate rows and other ways to clean this data then use models like (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes) and compare between them to detect the best fit model to this problem.
